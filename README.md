# Pi-FaceRecognition

This code is a Python script for face recognition using the face_recognition and OpenCV libraries.
The script uses imutils for resizing frames, face_recognition for face recognition, and pickle to load the known face encodings. 
Make sure to install these libraries before running the script.
